# start_page
My experimental start page using HTML CSS and JS.
Currently hosted on Berkeley's Open Computing Facility's servers at:
https://ocf.io/yassermth/

Next step would be eliminating JS and making a great page using only HTML and CSS.

The website in it's current state include a welcoming text, changable Arabic and English qoutes on top and bottom (from a list I collected myself), and a changable random background set of pictures (in the process of switching them to pictures I have taken myself).
